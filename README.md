# MicrosleepDetection
This project suggests and describe a method for detecting drowsiness in drivers by  detecting eye closure using transfer learning. The suggested method is used to identify  the eye state conditions of a driver. A dataset from MRL Eye Dataset will be used to  train the system.
The model will be using webcam to detects the eye state of the driver. The webcam will be placed in front of the users closely to detect the eyes. The system is designed to deal with face areas in the video captured. The reasons to use the face areas is to detect the eyes features withing the face. The videos are change into image frames per second to locate the eyes positions. When the eyes are located, the eye state will determine whether the eyes are open or closed. If the eyes detected to be closed for more than 10 consecutive frames, the eyes are considered closed and this show that the driver are drowsy which then the driver will get alerted.
